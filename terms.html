      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">You are solely responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to Your transactions, and for reporting and paying those taxes to the relevant authorities. We do not collect, report, or withhold taxes unless required by law. Where legally obligated, We may withhold taxes from amounts payable to You and report such withholdings.

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">At this time, the Platform supports deposits in Virtual Currencies only.

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">You agree that We will have the right to withhold any Orders for transfer of Virtual Currency from Your User Account to an External Account, if We believe or suspect that You may be engaging in or have engaged in fraudulent, collusive, unlawful or improper activity, or if We are concerned about the operation of the User Account or the withdrawal request. In such cases, We may commence and/or be involved in and/or assist any investigation into such circumstances, and You agree to assist and cooperate with any such investigation.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">In the event that We plan to delist a Virtual Currency from the Platform, You will be notified in advance and required to withdraw any remaining balance in that currency from Your User Account before support ends.

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">We will not sell, lend, pledge, or otherwise use Your Funds without Your instruction, except as expressly permitted under these Terms or required by law.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">While Your Funds remain Your property, We cannot guarantee they will be free from any competing legal claims under applicable law.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Subject to downtime, system maintenance, legal holds, or other applicable restrictions, You may request the withdrawal of Your Virtual Currency at any time by instructing us to transfer it to an External Account.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">We reserve the right to seek criminal and contractual sanctions against You if We have any reason to suspect that You are involved in fraudulent, dishonest or criminal acts, and will make such reports as necessary to the authorities. We reserve the right to withhold payment to You where You are suspected of engaging in fraudulent, dishonest or criminal activities.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">2.4. Forks and Airdrops</span></p>

      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">4.1. Scope and Nature of Perpetual Futures Contracts</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">The Platform offers access to Perpetual Futures Contracts&mdash;derivative financial instruments that enable Users to speculate on the future price of supported Virtual Currencies without an expiry date. These contracts are margined and settled in USDT or other supported assets as may be specified on the Platform. The execution and management of these contracts, including leverage, funding rates, and risk controls, are governed by these Terms.</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">4.2. Leverage and Liquidation</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Users may select leverage levels within the parameters set by the Platform. You acknowledge that use of leverage amplifies both potential gains and potential losses. If the margin level in Your account falls below the maintenance threshold, We reserve the right to partially or fully liquidate Your open positions without prior notice to prevent further losses.</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">4.3. Funding Fees</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Funding rates may be applied periodically between long and short positions.

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">4.4. Risks and Warnings</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Perpetual Futures involve high risk and are intended for experienced Users familiar with leveraged trading. You are solely responsible for monitoring Your positions and ensuring You maintain adequate margin. We make no guarantees regarding the profitability of any Futures Contract and disclaim liability for losses arising from price volatility, forced liquidations, or market disruptions.</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Margin Trading</span></strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.1. Nature of Margin Trading</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">The Platform may, at its discretion, extend trading leverage to eligible Users by offering Margin Trading services. Margin Trading allows You to enter into larger positions than Your available balance by borrowing additional funds, subject to available collateral and risk limits.</span></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Access to Margin Trading is subject to additional eligibility criteria, including identity verification, trading experience, and risk profiling. The Company reserves the right to approve, restrict, or suspend access to Margin Trading at its sole discretion and without prior notice.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.2. Collateral, Margin Types, and Leverage</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">When engaging in Margin Trading, Your account will reflect the following margin components:</span></p>
      <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Initial Margin (IM):</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">&nbsp;The minimum collateral required to open a leveraged position. This is calculated as a percentage of the position&apos;s notional value.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Maintenance Margin (MM):</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">&nbsp;The minimum amount of equity that must be maintained to keep a position open. Falling below this threshold may trigger a liquidation.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Position Margin:</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">&nbsp;The sum of Initial Margin and Maintenance Margin that secures an open position. This amount is calculated based on position size, leverage, and asset risk tier.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">The Platform may implement tiered margin requirements, where larger positions require proportionally higher margin and may have reduced maximum leverage.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.3. &nbsp;Risk Management and Margin Calls</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">We may use automated systems to monitor Your margin ratio in real time. If Your Margin Ratio (equity &divide; maintenance margin) falls below a defined threshold, You may receive a Margin Call prompting You to deposit more collateral. If unaddressed, Your position may be liquidated.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">You understand and accept that:</span></p>
      <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Partial liquidation may occur in stages to reduce position size and mitigate losses.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">In extreme cases, full liquidation may occur without further notice.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Liquidation may result in additional losses beyond Your original investment.</span></p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.4. Responsibility and Risk Disclosure</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Borrowed funds incur interest, calculated and accrued periodically. Interest rates may vary by asset and market conditions. Full details are provided in the Margin Trading Rules posted on the Platform.</span></p>
      <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.5.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Risk Warnings</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Margin Trading is highly speculative. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Losses may exceed Your collateral, and You may be required to deposit additional funds. You are solely responsible for managing risk and understanding how margin is calculated and used.</span></p>
      <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">5.6.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Liquidation Process and Final Settlement</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">In the event of liquidation, the Platform may:</span></p>
      <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Cancel open orders to free up collateral;</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Close all or part of Your positions;</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">Apply liquidation penalties or fees where applicable.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p>
          </li>
      </ul>
